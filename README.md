  * This panel consists of headline/title, paragraph, form with email input field and submit  button, and also close button. The panel size should not be more than 640px wide.
  * This panel should be shown only after scrolling down to about ​one-third​ of the page and must be ​animated sliding up​ - not just suddenly appears. After being shown, this panel keeps on showing/visible even when scrolling up back to the top of the page.
  * This panel should be placed at the ​bottom-left corner ​of the screen ​and stay there​ as the page is scrolled down/up.
  * This panel could be hidden/removed by clicking the close button on top-right of the panel.
